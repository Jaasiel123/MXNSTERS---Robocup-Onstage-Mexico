Documentation of codes that we are using for the International Robocup Tournament, in the Onstage category where we will develop a performance of the movie Monster Inc.

Each robot is distributed by folders with its various codes, which were made in IDE's such as Arduino, Python, Open Mv. 
In addition to the ones already commented, there are the authors who made these codes for performance purposes as part of 
the International Robocup Thailand 2022 Tournament, which will be held from July 13 to 17 of this year.
